Hello there! I am, or well, known as "Mip", but I go by many other alliases online too.

I like to develop in a wide range of environments, such as but not limited to;
- Python
- Lua
- Batch (Windows Exclusive)
- Along with many others!

I'm primarily interested in getting to work on projects such as reverse enegineering API's, and other programs
to make them do things they were never intended to do, or on how they should've never been used. Such as my "MipCord" project.

I also enjoy taking up projects I've never have done before, so that I may make mistake and learn from them, allowing me to
further expand my know-how.
